<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
<p>Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to create.

So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language: </p>
 <ul>
        <li> A <i>markup</i> language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. </li>
         </br>
        <li> In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.</li>
         </br>
        <li><i>HyperText </i> is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course. </li>
    </ul>
     </br>
